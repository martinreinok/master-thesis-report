\label{ch:simulation-and-detection}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Issues with the original}
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item Unstable
        \item Over-complicated (2 CAN-bus, Raspberry-pi etc.)
        \item Software not easily manageable or expandable
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Software And Hardware Improvements}
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item Communication reduced to single CAN bus.
        \item Raspberry pi removed from the system altogether
        \item Build-in PID controller used for Admittance control
        \item Homing made easier
        \item Master data fits in single CAN message
        \item Ability to change Master Device resistance using external CAN-bus device.
        \item Slave uses direct encoder values to move pneumatic motors, very direct, simple and predictable.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Integration with CNN software}
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item Communication over CAN bus.
        \item Resistance is increased or decreased depending on collision severity.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Improvements Results and Analysis}
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item Clinicians test and feedback.
        \item With resistance and without resistance review.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
